The majority of code in this repository is derived from https://github.com/TavoGLC/DataAnalysisByExample authored by Octavio Gonzalez-Lugo, which is a repository for the author's medium blog series on parameter estimation for differential equations (https://medium.com/@octaviogl69).

I merely decomposed the code and reorganized them so that I could understand the mechanism better.
